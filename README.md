# CCEAP: Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol

The *Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol* (CCEAP) is a simple network protocol designed for teaching covert channels (network steganography) to professionals and students.

The protocol is explicitly vulnerable against several [hiding patterns](http://ih-patterns.blogspot.de/p/introduction.html), i.e. patterns that represent hiding methods (steganographic methods that create covert channels). The protocol's structure is simple and self-explanatory and its implementation is kept at a minimum level of code lines to make it especially accessible to students. The documentation of the protocol and the tool can be found [here](https://github.com/cdpxe/CCEAP/tree/master/documentation). In addition, there is an [academic paper available for download](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2989037&CFID=856548232&CFTOKEN=62229078).

Please send requests and feedback to the author: Steffen Wendzel, [www.wendzel.de](http://www.wendzel.de) (wendzel (at) hs-worms (dot) de). Research on steganographic/covert channel teaching in higher education is currently performed by [Steffen Wendzel and Wojciech Mazurczyk](http://ih-patterns.blogspot.de/p/authorscontact.html).
