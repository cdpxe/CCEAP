# CCEAP

The *Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol* (CCEAP) is a network protocol designed for teaching covert channels to professionals and students.

The protocol is explicitly vulnerable against several [hiding patterns](http://ih-patterns.blogspot.de/p/introduction.html) so that switching protocols while explaining hiding patterns is not necessary. The protocol's structure is simple and self-explanatory and its implementation is kept at a minimum level of code lines to make it especially accessible to students.

Research on covert channel teaching is currently performed by [Steffen Wendzel and Wojciech Mazurczyk](http://ih-patterns.blogspot.de/p/authorscontact.html).
