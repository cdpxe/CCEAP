# CCEAP: Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol

The *Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol* (CCEAP) is a simple network protocol designed for teaching covert channels (network steganography) to professionals and students.

The protocol is explicitly vulnerable against several [hiding patterns](http://ih-patterns.blogspot.de/p/introduction.html), i.e. patterns that represent hiding methods (steganographic methods that create covert channels). The protocol's structure is simple and self-explanatory and its implementation is kept at a minimum level of code lines to make it especially accessible to students. There is also a [documentation](https://github.com/cdpxe/CCEAP/tree/master/documentation) and an [academic paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2989037&CFID=856548232&CFTOKEN=62229078) available.
